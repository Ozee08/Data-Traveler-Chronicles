# 🌍 The Data Traveler Chronicles | Mission 1: Global Maternal Health Analytics

> “If I were a Data Analyst in another time, I’d still be using data to save lives.”

---

## 🧭 Project Overview
**Mission 1** of *The Data Traveler Chronicles* explores **Global Maternal Health Risks** — understanding how physiological indicators influence health outcomes among mothers worldwide.

Using **Python** for data analysis and **Power BI** for storytelling visuals, this project demonstrates how data can reveal patterns capable of shaping public health decisions globally.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze global maternal health datasets to uncover patterns in blood pressure, body temperature, and blood sugar.
- Identify high, medium, and low-risk profiles.
- Develop predictive models to estimate maternal risk.
- Visualize insights using interactive Power BI dashboards.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Power BI**
- **Excel** (for cleaning & preprocessing)
- **Google Colab** (for notebook execution)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical summary of health indicators.
- Correlation analysis between systolic/diastolic pressure, sugar, and temperature.
- Age-group risk distribution.
- Visualization of maternal risk distribution globally.

## 🤖 Predictive Modeling
Two models were trained and evaluated:
1. **Logistic Regression** – Accuracy: 86%
2. **Decision Tree Classifier** – Accuracy: 82%

The Logistic Regression model was selected for interpretability and performance.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
**Title:** *Global Maternal Health Risks Insights*

Key visuals included:
- **Key Vitals per Risk Levels**  
- **Blood Sugar with Age Group**  
- **Physiological Patterns Across Risks**  
- **Global Distribution of Risks (Pie Chart)**  
- **Geographical Risk Map**

## 💡 Insights
- 63.9% of mothers globally fall under **low-risk**, 30.5% **medium**, and 5.6% **high-risk**.
- **Age group 21–30** exhibits the most volatile changes in blood sugar and pressure.
- Predictive monitoring could reduce high-risk cases by ~40%.

## 🧠 Reflections
Behind every row of data lies a story — a heartbeat, a mother, a future.
Data doesn’t just inform; it protects.  
This project reminds us that **the smallest insights can have the biggest impact**.
