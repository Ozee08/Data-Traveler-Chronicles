## 🧭 Upline Narrative — A Data Traveler’s Journey

As a **Data Traveler**, I ventured into the unseen territories of mental wellness—guided by numbers, patterns, and human stories. This mission explores how **sleep, stress, exercise**, and **mental health conditions** shape happiness and overall well-being.

Where others saw ordinary survey responses…  
I saw a map to healthier living.
