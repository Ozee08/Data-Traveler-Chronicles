# **The Data Traveler Chronicles: Mission 4 — Why Small Businesses Fail in 3–5 Years**

### *“We decode failure — and rewrite its survival.”*

---

##  Project Overview  

In this mission, I explored **why small businesses fail within their first 3–5 years** — a recurring challenge in the entrepreneurial landscape.  
Using **Python** and **Excel** for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature creation, I built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** that uncovers the patterns behind early business collapse.  

As a **Business Intelligence Analyst**, my goal was not only to interpret the numbers — but to tell the story that lives beneath them.

##  Data Preparation  

The dataset was generated and refined through Python processes, then enhanced with computed metrics such as:

- **Failure Rate (%)**  
- **Survival Rate (%)**  
- **Average Profit Margin (%)**  
- **Average Revenue Growth (₦)**  
- **Industry Risk Category**  
- **Marketing Efficiency**  
- **Management Experience Index**  
- **Customer Satisfaction Score**

All values were standardized for industry comparability and temporal analysis (across years 2010–2024).

##  Dashboard Overview

The Power BI visualization presents key insights across **500 businesses**, focusing on failure drivers and resilience indicators.  
Here’s a breakdown of the visuals and the stories they tell:

### **1. Overall Business Health**
- **500 Total Businesses** were tracked, revealing a staggering **85% failure rate**.  
- Despite modest **average profit margins (4.8%)**, some industries sustain themselves through customer retention and adaptability.

### **2. Industry Vulnerability**
- The **Real Estate (91%)** and **Technology (88%)** sectors show the highest vulnerability, emphasizing over-leverage and misaligned capital allocation.  
- On the other hand, **Retail** and **Healthcare** show comparative resilience through steady consumer demand.

### **3. Risk Distribution**
- **58.8% of businesses fall into the “High Risk” zone**, often linked to poor financial planning and weak operational management.  
- Only **40%** sustain a “Low Risk” profile — mostly industries with consistent cash flow and low debt ratios.

### **4. Revenue Growth Trends**
- A visible **downtrend in revenue growth** after 2015 shows how small businesses struggled post-economic disruptions and capital tightening.  
- Businesses that maintained **moderate revenue growth post-2020** prioritized digital transformation and lean operations.

### **5. Marketing & Management Insights**
- High-performing sectors invested **more than 100% ROI-equivalent** in marketing — proving visibility fuels survival.  
- **Management experience** has a direct correlation with survival; companies with **>5 years leadership experience** showed a **9.3% higher success rate**.

### **6. Customer Satisfaction**
- **Real Estate** and **Retail** scored highest in satisfaction, proving that customer experience still defines business endurance.

✅ **Industries that digitized faster** post-2018 are showing renewed growth curves.  
✅ **Customer satisfaction** remains the most underleveraged but powerful retention driver.
